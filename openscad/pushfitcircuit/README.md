* laser cutting

the dxf is a combination of the engraving (made in inkscape) pushfit.svg, and a dxf file exported from openscad.

If you're using material much different to 3mm thickness, then you'll need to change the thickness parameter in the openscad file, then re-export the dxf and combine with the engraving.
